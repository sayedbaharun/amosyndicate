## Design Principles Applied

1. **Reduction**
   - Removed 80% of visual elements
   - Kept only what serves function

2. **Precision**
   - Every spacing value is intentional
   - Typography scale follows musical ratios

3. **Restraint**
   - Single accent color
   - No decorative elements
   - Animations only for state changes

4. **Clarity**
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Obvious interaction points
   - No ambiguous UI patterns

5. **Performance**
   - Instant response
   - Minimal resource usage
   - Optimized for speed

## The Result

A website that doesn't try to impress with effects, but with confidence. It doesn't shout "luxury" - it simply is luxurious through its restraint and precision.

The gold accent is used exactly 3 times:
1. The AMO wordmark hover
2. Contact link in navigation  
3. Text selection

Everything else is black on white or white on black. No gradients. No shadows. No effects.

This is design at its most essential - where every pixel has a purpose and nothing exists without reason.

## Files Created for Minimal Version
- `/components/layout/HeaderMinimal.tsx`
- `/components/layout/FooterMinimal.tsx`
- `/components/home/HeroMinimal.tsx`
- `/components/home/ServicesMinimal.tsx`
- `/components/portfolio/BrandGrid.tsx`
- `/app/globals-ive.css` (reference stylesheet)

## To Switch Back
The original design is preserved in:
- `/app/page-old.tsx` (original homepage)
- Original components remain untouched
